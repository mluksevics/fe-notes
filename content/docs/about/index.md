# About me

I am [Marcis Luksevics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksevics/). 
I studied BEng and MEng civil engineering in Latvia before moving to the UK and working for 5 years for [BuroHappold](https://www.burohappold.com/) in their head office in Bath. 
After achieving a chartership CEng MICE, I moved back to Latvia and helped [UPB](https://www.upb.lv/en) with their first project in London. 

There is a sad part about these notes - I wrote those at the time when I was about to pivot to the software engineering industry. In a way - these are notes to myself about lessons learned over the years working as a structural engineer. 

Currently (in 2023) I still do (and enjoy) structural engineering - but those are side jobs in parallel to working full-time as a .NET developer. 

Some of the buildings I have modelled myself are the [Prospect Place](https://batterseapowerstation.co.uk/apartments/prospect-place/)
buildings in London designed by Frank Gehry architects and entry canopies for the
[Museum of The Future](https://museumofthefuture.ae/en) in Dubai. I definitely do not claim to
have taken a major role in the design of such prominent buildings, however,
these are actual FE models I have created and have learned a lot by
working on such signature and also smaller projects. Another good perspective was 
being responsible for the glass and aluminium facade structural design for the [Bloom Clerkenwell](https://hbreavis.com/en/project/bloomclerkenwell/) building in London.

I hope you find my notes useful to your journey in engineering.
